Full Stack Open Course part 2

This is the repo for all the projects and their respective tasks relating to FullStackOpen part 2. Although most of the concepts contained in this part were at least somewhat familiar to me, I did learn new things and it was a nice refreshing of my memory and different ideas I had not utilized in some time. Particularly the use of Axios and APIs was interesting and thought provoking.
